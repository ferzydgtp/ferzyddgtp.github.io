        <h2> Fauna </h2>
        <p id="country"> Australia has a unique fauna, and this is due to the fact that during the Miocene the Earth experienced a major climate change event, from which Australia remained isolated. As a result, the animal species that inhabited this country followed a different development compared to other species present in other areas of the planet. However, it is also said that the high Australian endemic fauna is due to the stability of the tectonic plates of the country or the fact that there are atypical patterns of climate change in the area.<br> </p>

             There are over 22,000 species of flora in Australia. Of these, over 90% are indigenous, and a large proportion of these species are found only in these lands, i.e. they are endemic. Australia's vegetation is very diverse and includes everything from dense populations of shrubs or eucalyptus, to Mugla and Mallee. However, the predominant vegetation is perennial.
